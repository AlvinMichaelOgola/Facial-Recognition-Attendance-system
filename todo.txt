1. Add a mechanism where the set up of an accout uses a geenric password that is sent to the persons email to allow them to log in and they will be prompted to change it when they log in#
2. Not all the functionalities are done in the manage lecs#
pupulate the dropdowns
refactor the form details to make them more robust#
The issue with the search bar in the manage users module#
for the capture face in manage users, ensure it soft deletes the old embeddings and uses the new ones

Make sure that the add class thing works, and registers to the database
